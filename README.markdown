Zenflow is a work in progress.

### Getting Started 

Make sure github.user is set globally and that you have a zenflow token:

    git config --global github.user yourusername
    zenflow authorize

Each git project requires a yaml config file '.zenflow' to be present. This can be created with:

    zenflow config

To start a feature in Zenflow:

    zenflow feature start make-it-awesome
	
TODO: Would be great to get a typical flow documented in here.

### Usage

    zenflow --help
